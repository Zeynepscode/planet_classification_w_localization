# Planet Classification and Localization


Hi!
This project is about image classification with localization. I chose some planet images. I can't share the trained model due to the size of it. However, I will explain step-by-step here, you can train yourself on google colab and examine the results and codes in detail.

## Installation

In this section, you can save necessary files on drive by opening the "installation.ipynb" file with google colab and drive connection.
