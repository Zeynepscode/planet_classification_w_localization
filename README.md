# Planet Classification and Localization


Hi!
This project is about image classification with localization. I chose some planet images. I can't share the trained model due to the size of it. However, I will explain step-by-step here, you can train yourself on google colab and examine the results and codes in detail.

## Installation
Open google colob and select github tab then copy my github link and select "installation.ipynb" file.
Connect your drive to google colab(make sure that at every step.)
Create a new folder named as Colab Notebooks.(if there is not such a file)
Run "installation.ipynb" file.
Open "create_training_data.ipynb".After that you will have an dataset.npy file on your drive.(it can take a while)
In "train_keras" first only run numpy 1.16 section then take it as a comment line.
Check whether you work with cpu or gpu.It has to be GPU.Then run all.
