# Planet Classification and Localization


Hi!
In this project I build a model responsible for predicting the planet as well as the bounding box around the planet.I can't share the trained model due to the size of it. However, I will explain step-by-step here, you can train yourself on google colab and examine the results and codes in detail.

## Installation
Open google colob and select github tab then copy my github link and select "installation.ipynb" file.
Connect your drive to google colab(make sure that at every step and delete cell after drive connection )
Create a new folder named as Colab Notebooks.(if there is not such a file)
Run "installation.ipynb" file.
Open "create_training_data.ipynb".After that you will have an dataset.npy file on your drive.(it can take a while)
In "train_keras" first only run numpy 1.16 section then take it as a comment line.
Check whether you work with cpu or gpu.It has to be GPU.Lastly,run test_keras file and see the results!
